## Design of spatial data Models

Only focus on class diagram. Need to comment on some details. 

**How is a GML defined?** （如何从xml来的）

**give a GML, explain what is defined here.**

Go through **XML-Basics** and **XML schema**.

## 考试提示

-	(EXAM) Two tutorials about XML that will be relevant for the exam (exam after the tutorial will be similar)
-	Exam:
		Duration 1,5 hours but with a buffer and no strict threshold
		1st appointment = 2nd of February
2nd appointment = 1st of march it is (two to four o’clock)
3rd appointment = 22nd of march
		Blackboard or handwritten will be released yet

1. Make sure to know what is behind the **terminology** 
   - (feature, entity, class, objects etc.)

3. ~~easy points to collect (stupid and easy type of questions);~~
4. Also some types of context oriented question were you **need logic** 
   - (“**importance of business process modelling**” / **why do we need** that); 
5. Also maybe a **snippet** of a process model (“do you see some data in this model”) 
6. ~~Always go for the easy points first;~~ 
7. What could also come: **example** of a data model and **normalize it** or **how could** we make the data model **better**; 
8. :eight_pointed_black_star:***​potentially “this is a textual description but now make a UML class diagram about that”***
9. be sure to know **modelling notation**!; 
10. Also some questions with regards to **attributes multiplicities**;
11. ~~**only UML Class diagrams**;~~
12. Some easy questions (true/false) with regards to the XML (**tutorial**); 
13. Some questions about **XML schema** (what is shown here); 
14. Some questions with regards to **GML**; 
15. Some questions with regards to **XML namespace**;
16. Some questions about the **General feature model** (what type of attributes definitions, relationships etc.);
17. Relationship between **Geospatial standards** (**where** does **GM_Point** for example **come from**); 
18. ~~**No** specific **ISO norms**;~~
19. focus on **UML notation**： 1.interpret 2.draw 3.normalize!!!

- Most important questions: it will be quite a mixture of questions;
- The exam will be around 60 points  pass mark around 52%。
- 30% to 40% percent will be about the UML class diagrams
- During the exam we are allowed to ask questions。
- No bad surprises but do not take it too lightly
- Exam on the same thing we did in class; before you answer nothing, answer bullshit;
-  For every question there will be in brackets the number of points he will give

### General feature model (GFM)

It is a ‘metamodel’ for feature types.

Like defining what kind of attributes, methods and associations can be defined.
