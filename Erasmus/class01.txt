A is essentially paying a nominal fee. It's around twenty Euro a it's essentially a student council membership fee, which at the same time provides insurance and it's used as a mechanism, to authenticate your admission to the university of salzburg and these twenty us a year have to be, paid individually. There is no way that say a university pace for a all the five students from this university. Because it's kind of an authentication mechanism of individuals. Um so this fee has to be paid and a as to a wife at the university until the last day, of this month. So until October 31 a usually these transfers are going through in the same day or next day. But don't leave it to kind of the last minute or last day. Um whenever you receive a email please go ahead and pay that immediately. There's a couple of payment options a typically the system with the CoD payment. Um and we are aware that international students we have, mostly international students insights book typically a tell us that's a predispose voices out there.
A本质上是支付象征性的费用。大约是二十欧元，本质上是学生会会员费，同时提供保险，并用作一种机制，以验证您进入萨尔茨堡大学的录取，而这二十个我们每年必须单独支付。对于这所大学的所有五个学生来说，这是不可能说大学的速度。因为它是一种个人的身份验证机制。嗯，所以这笔费用必须支付给大学的妻子，直到本月的最后一天。因此，直到10月31日，这些转移通常在同一天或第二天进行。但不要把它留到最后一分钟或最后一天。嗯，每当您收到电子邮件时，请继续并立即付款。有几个付款方式，通常是具有CoD付款的系统。嗯，我们知道我们有国际学生，主要是国际学生的见解书，通常告诉我们这是一个倾向性的声音。

2023/10/18 18:16:46
Again this applies to the majority of you but not everyone. It applies to those who do not yet have a full admission of, sometimes called this material number student idea university of cyborg. This is needed for two different apps is a one, is that you can receive credit but secondly that you are eligible for asthma, scope funding from your home university um for the trip and stay to a moat. Yeah, that obviously applies to everyone um who is not already a student. A and you poll at alma mater university a because you unfortunately can not get any extra funding. For its still consider as most scheme um and um we are within that framework. So for that process this is kind of the real urgent. Think um where we want to emphasize watch out for that. Email and make this approximately twenty year payment really wide. Away um do it um kind of immediately when you receive that.
同样，这适用于你们大多数人，但不是每个人。它适用于那些尚未完全录取的人，有时称为此材料编号学生想法 半机械人大学。这是两个不同的应用程序需要的，一个是你可以获得学分，其次是你有资格患哮喘，从你的母校资助，用于旅行和留在护城河。是的，这显然适用于所有还不是学生的人。A和你在母校A进行民意调查，因为不幸的是你无法获得任何额外的资金。因为它仍然被认为是大多数方案 um 和 um 我们在这个框架内。因此，对于这个过程来说，这是真正紧迫的。想想我们想强调的地方，要注意这一点。电子邮件并使这大约二十年的付款非常广泛。当你收到它时，嗯嗯立即做。

2023/10/18 18:17:01
A as this is kind of the key and most important item here. Um, I just want to check with you whether there's any questions, um, whether there is any.
A 因为这是这里的关键和最重要的项目。嗯，我只是想和你核实一下有没有问题，嗯，有没有。

2023/10/18 18:17:17

2023/10/18 18:18:10
Who do not make the October fest deadline and again to emphasize its a deadline a where this amount has to be, has to a life has to be credited to the university of sites berg. Um, so don't make the trends from the last day of the month. A go ahead and make it right away again, everyone who is not already admitted.
谁不使十月节截止日期，并再次强调这是一个截止日期，这个金额必须，必须归功于网站伯格大学的生活。嗯，所以不要从每月的最后一天开始做趋势。继续前进，马上再做一次，所有尚未被录取的人。

2023/10/18 18:19:47
Um, so um, we insights book work with what's called a single sign on framework. So your IDs a you might say well you're not, maybe not even coming to such but you're not going to login locally here. Well I'm still keep in mind that the entire primarily our chess online platform what we are using, in a cold environment. Um, you will be authenticated with those credentials and this will be a for our next meeting in, say about two weeks time and we'll mention suggestions for potential dates before we finish today. I'm so.

2023/10/18 18:20:21
That's important to keep a there's one more point which may be a you are not aware of, a but um, I'll hand it over to fit for that because everyone who travels for the compulsory final week, residential week uh-huh to all amounts and wants to get a asthma scale funding for accommodation and purple, this is typically affixed bulk amount.
重要的是要保持一点，这可能是你不知道的，但是嗯，我会把它交给适合那个，因为每个旅行的人都在强制性的最后一周，住宿周呃呃到所有金额，并希望获得哮喘规模资金的住宿和紫色， 这通常是贴满量。

2023/10/18 18:20:27
Um, from your home university, this typically requires.
嗯，从你的母校，这通常需要。

2023/10/18 18:20:39
Z signing or the re-existence of an AI a, and that's an in constitutional agreement between the involved universities.
Z 签名或 AI a 的重新存在，这是相关大学之间的宪法协议。

2023/10/18 18:20:47
And in those universities, in this case, itis book, and once you the admission.
在那些大学里，在这种情况下，它是书，一旦你被录取。

2023/10/18 18:21:57
Um, you're good. You will get the credit from sites berg. So the agreement with sites book um should be there. I think it's obligatory and for everyone who wants to get some travel funding from your home university, such an agreement with all modes is required as well. So maybe video can briefly talk about two points here. Who would be the contact person a on your side, because you're students typically would not handle this intense intense institutional agreement. But you need to make sure that your international department of the university, or the departmental asma's coordinator in your study program or department, um, is aware that they have to check such an equipment exists. Maybe you can then continue with some of the practical's of this. Stay in almost if that's okay with you feed to be happy to hand it over to you.
嗯，你很好。您将从网站伯格获得信用。所以与网站书的协议应该在那里。我认为这是强制性的，对于每个想从你的母校获得一些旅行资金的人来说，也需要与所有模式达成这样的协议。所以也许视频可以在这里简要谈谈两点。谁会是你这边的联系人，因为你是学生，通常不会处理这种激烈的机构协议。但是你需要确保你的大学国际部门，或者你的学习计划或部门的部门ASMA协调员，嗯，知道他们必须检查这样的设备是否存在。也许你可以继续一些实用的。如果可以的话，请留在里面，以便乐意将其交给您。

2023/10/18 18:22:48
Yes, thank you very much. As for z contracts, um, most of the universities that you are studying currently have. The I I A contract with us with you both except to micha and dumas. So these are only two universities that don't have this contact with us. But don't worry us students do not have to take care of anything in this matter, because me and my colleague yama who is the coordinator, at our department is already in contact with your teachers and your your um coordinators at your home, institutions to make it happen. So the rest of you we have a common contract with your university and as professor stowe was mentioned, um.
是的，非常感谢。至于z合同，嗯，你目前就读的大多数大学都有。I I A 与我们签订的合同，除了米夏和杜马斯。所以这只是两所与我们没有这种联系的大学。但是不用担心，我们学生在这件事上不必照顾任何事情，因为我和我的同事Yama是我们部门的协调员，已经与你们的老师联系，你们是你们家里的UM协调员，机构来实现它。所以你们其他人，我们和你们的大学有共同的合同，正如斯托教授提到的，嗯。

2023/10/18 18:23:15
If you are Co financed by the erasmus plus programme, which means that your home institution is paying for your stay enormous, so you're a erasmus coordinators will already know what to do in order to get you into the almost so. It's all paid by the air as moose, but from your home institutions in order to be able to come to all modes.
如果您是由伊拉斯谟加计划共同资助的，这意味着您的家庭机构正在为您的住宿支付巨额费用，因此您是伊拉斯谟协调员，已经知道该怎么做才能让您进入几乎如此。这一切都是像驼鹿一样由空中支付的，但来自您的家庭机构，以便能够进入所有模式。

2023/10/18 18:23:30

2023/10/18 18:24:33
Lending program. So don't worry you will get more and more information about the residential week, as the time goes on because now you are about to have the virtual part. And that's the scope of this whole arises, blended intensive program. It combines virtual mobility, the physical one, and as I mentioned for the physical one, you need support from European union, from erasmus, and this is on the level of the coordinators to take care.
贷款计划。因此，随着时间的流逝，请不要担心您将获得有关住宅周的更多信息，因为现在您即将拥有虚拟部分。这就是整个混合强化计划的范围。它结合了虚拟移动性，物理移动性，正如我提到的物理移动性，您需要欧盟，伊拉斯谟的支持，这是协调员要注意的级别。

So the maximum z time spend you can spend normally from the third to eleventh.

2023/10/18 18:33:49

Um, we roll in throughout our forthcoming meetings, talk a bit more about this project.
嗯，我们在即将举行的会议上继续讨论，更多地谈论这个项目。

2023/10/18 18:34:21
But you should already start thinking about that ISS there in your local community.
但是你应该已经开始考虑当地社区的国际空间站了。

2023/10/18 18:34:36
Um, is there any issue which is currently being dealt with? It might be mobility and transportation planning, it might be a change to sounding, it might be environmental issues.
嗯，目前有什么问题正在处理吗？可能是交通和交通规划，可能是声音的变化，可能是环境问题。

2023/10/18 18:34:49
Think about issues and topics which may be close to your heart, but you're really invested personally. Some sing you always wanted to take a little bit deep and get some excuse to do that.
想想那些可能贴近你内心的问题和话题，但你真的投入了个人。有些唱歌你总是想深入一点，找一些借口这样做。

2023/10/18 18:35:05
This course is a six ICTs course, which means, depending on the metrics we usually work with a it covered some 150 to 180 hours of.
本课程是一门六门ICT课程，这意味着，根据我们通常使用的指标，它涵盖了大约150至180个小时。

开始考虑公众参与项目。嗯，我们，嗯，你，嗯，有一个主题成为你的个人环境，嗯，在那些感兴趣的领域，你有动力更深入一点。

2023/10/18 18:36:29
Which is equally important when you have some kind of community you address with this project. It can be friends and family. It can be your gears, a from say your hiking chap, um your fellow students. Um, because when we develop a one or another type of mobile application, a then it's not you who should acquire data and, it's not a field mapping cos it's a participation costs. So that means there should be other people you have access to. Of course you can put a call in the local newspaper but maybe that doesn't work out so well. It might be pretty long loop until you get that going.
当你有某种社区通过这个项目解决时，这一点同样重要。它可以是朋友和家人。它可以是你的齿轮，一个从你的远足小伙子，嗯你的同学。嗯，因为当我们开发一种或另一种类型的移动应用程序时，应该获取数据的不是你，也不是字段映射，而是参与成本。因此，这意味着您应该可以访问其他人。当然，你可以在当地报纸上打电话，但也许效果不佳。在你开始之前，这可能是相当长的循环。

2023/10/18 18:36:44
And you would like to have some Foster experiences. So, so again, we'll be discussing that, um, and developed a couple of minutes in each and every one of the forthcoming webinars um, but.
你想有一些福斯特的经历。所以，再一次，我们将讨论这个问题，嗯，并在即将举行的每个网络研讨会中开发几分钟，嗯，但是。

2023/10/18 18:36:50
In mind as well. In other words, stop thinking about that.
也记住了。换句话说，不要再想这个问题了。

2023/10/18 18:37:01
One, I'm really short. Well, maybe. Let's, let's why? Um, if you find two ways, your hands button.
第一，我真的很矮。好吧，也许吧。让我们，让我们为什么？嗯，如果你找到两种方式，你的手按钮。

2023/10/18 18:37:15
AI would be interested to find out among all of those who are here, right now who has any kind of experience with the archie's online platform.
AI有兴趣在座的所有人中找出现在对archie的在线平台有任何经验的人。

2023/10/18 18:37:27
To be clear, that's not a prerequisite. Yeah, that's a curiosity question. So maybe everyone ways your hands. Um, who has worked with rps online before?
需要明确的是，这不是先决条件。是的，这是一个好奇的问题。所以也许每个人都会动手。嗯，谁以前在线使用过 rps？

2023/10/18 18:38:08
Yeah. Okay, so that's right. Now it's about one third of those who are present. A few more have felt a ways ahead button. OK, thank you. That's a good indication. Um, you have now a button again where you can take down your hand. Feel free to do so. And you have this button as well. So you pass the first hof test in the costs already. Thank you. So we will be working with this platform a which typically when we log in here.
是的。好的，没错。现在大约有三分之一的人在场。更多的人已经感觉到了前进的按钮。好的，谢谢你。这是一个很好的迹象。嗯，你现在又有一个按钮，你可以拿下你的手。随意这样做。你也有这个按钮。因此，您已经通过了成本中的第一个hof测试。谢谢。因此，我们将使用这个平台，通常是当我们在此处登录时。

2023/10/18 18:39:23
Um then it would look like that you're lookin will be your university of sites book, single sign on um and the online training in a variety of tools, will be on the same platform. Um there is the the most interesting menu item in this interface is the APP launch up here. And while you have access to the entire platform and you won't even have access to a full, GPS per license, um we're not going to work with that. So this cost is entirely cloud based. So what you would need to participate in technical terms would be a browser and an intellectual kind. That's pretty much it. Um, if you have a choice of browser is gopher comb but others work as well. If you can do slack with code and if you look at this APP, launch a will of course be looking at a chess online. As such we will be working and that will be one of the starting points.
嗯，那么看起来你正在寻找的将是你的大学网站书，单点登录UM和各种工具的在线培训，将在同一平台上。嗯，这个界面中最有趣的菜单项是APP启动在这里。虽然您可以访问整个平台，但您甚至无法访问每个许可证的完整GPS，但我们不会使用它。因此，此成本完全基于云。因此，您需要参与技术术语的是浏览器和智力类型。差不多就是这样。嗯，如果你有浏览器的选择是地鼠梳，但其他人也可以。如果你能用代码松弛，如果你看看这个APP，启动一个当然会在网上看国际象棋。因此，我们将努力工作，这将是起点之一。

2023/10/18 18:39:44
Um, with quick capture, which is, as they say, a big button or set finger into face of working on your phones for mobile data acquisition, we definitely will going to survey one, two, three.
嗯，通过快速捕获，正如他们所说，这是一个大按钮或将手指放在手机上进行移动数据采集的脸上，我们肯定会调查一、二、三。

2023/10/18 18:39:55
For a map stand quick form based environment, we might or might not go a little bit into field maps.
对于基于地图站快速表单的环境，我们可能会也可能不会稍微介绍一下现场地图。

2023/10/18 18:40:00
We definitely will explore star maps because that's the.
我们肯定会探索星图，因为那是。

2023/10/18 18:40:30
Presentation interface for your results and um, we'll do a bit of dash boarding as well. Um, so you'll put together something like this when we find this. Can go to the individually partner universities and look at the dashboard at the bottom, the number of participants who are listed here. Um, we see the change of way. Shoes, I think it's.
结果的演示界面，嗯，我们还将做一些仪表板。嗯，所以当我们找到这个时，你会把这样的东西放在一起。可以去个别合作的大学，看看底部的仪表板，这里列出的参与者人数。嗯，我们看到了方式的变化。鞋子，我认为是的。

2023/10/18 18:40:45
Cure male participation from quack of a it's not the same in many other places. You can do the selection from the diagram down here, so that will be an example for.

Um, I would, um, give the challenge to go to the experience builder, which is a web development framework again for, for web apps, web apps, not native apps. So that will be the scope of the tools. And for all of theses tools, um, we will be working with an introduction we provide.
嗯，我会，嗯，挑战去体验构建器，这是一个 Web 开发框架，适用于 Web 应用程序、Web 应用程序，而不是本机应用程序。因此，这将是工具的范围。对于所有这些工具，嗯，我们将使用我们提供的介绍。

2023/10/18 18:41:28
Or orientation may be, and we will then point to a to what's called the s we academy.

2023/10/18 18:41:48
Um, and there's a bunch of courses out there.
嗯，那里有很多课程。

2023/10/18 18:42:12
It's going a bit slow, but it's going and this um, uh, don't do the law. Okay, there's many, many hundreds of courses. Um, we will highlight indeed bye week sessions. Those costs is we really want you to do and those where you would be welcome to dig a little bit deeper.
它进展得有点慢，但它正在前进，这个嗯，呃，不要做法律。好的，有很多很多很多的课程。嗯，我们将重点介绍确实再见周的会议。这些成本是我们真正希望您做的，也是欢迎您深入挖掘的费用。

2023/10/18 18:42:32
So, um, that's pretty much just for a general orientation. What will be happening over the next couple of weeks? Um, I can see that yama has her hand waste. Is that the leftover hand? Um, otherwise just unmute yourself.
所以，嗯，这几乎只是为了一个大致的方向。未来几周会发生什么？嗯，我看得出来，雅玛的手是浪费的。那是剩下的手吗？嗯，否则只需取消静音即可。

2023/10/18 18:42:35
If you have any comment or question.
如果您有任何意见或问题。

2023/10/18 18:42:41

或者，如果您想以同步方式进行聊天，请使用聊天。

2023/10/18 18:42:52
That's just as well, um, but maybe ozzie hand, it's just leftover from before, so it was me taking it down right now.
那也一样，嗯，但也许是奥兹手，它只是以前剩下的，所以现在是我把它拿下来。

2023/10/18 18:43:17

好。因此，在我们提出更多问题之前，我们有一个，我想听听一下您的可用性，嗯，至少是下一个网络研讨会，开始您的在线定位，也许可以先看一眼最有可能的一周。

2023/10/18 18:43:58
Um, there's two sides to that. One would be the time of today. So typically we of course want to avoid overlapping and collision with any glasses you have. So we can offer at AI think we're all in the same time zone as far as I can tell, maybe with one with no exception. I believe, um, so we can do that at four p~m, five p~m or six p~m and typically this webinar will be in the one and a half hour, ninety minutes long and I would guarantee them not to go over two hours.
嗯，这有两个方面。一个是今天的时间。因此，通常我们当然希望避免与您拥有的任何眼镜重叠和碰撞。因此，据我所知，我们可以在AI上提供我们认为我们都在同一个时区，也许无一例外。我相信，嗯，所以我们可以在下午四点~点，下午五点~米或六点~米做，通常这个网络研讨会将持续一个半小时，九十分钟长，我保证他们不会超过两个小时。

2023/10/18 18:44:04
Um, so let me start in the middle of that. Um, maybe?
嗯，让我从中间开始。嗯，也许吧？

2023/10/18 18:44:13
Those a few who say five o'clock is not good would raise your hand now.
那些说五点不好的几个人现在会举手。

2023/10/18 18:44:17

但除此之外，是的，我们的目标是下午六点~m~所以，基本上，就像今天一样，这让我想到了实际的日期问题。
